# URL Shortener

A URL Shortener site that allows you to create shorter aliases for long URLs. Users are redirected to the original URL when they hit these short links.

For example, if we shorten the following URL:

https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring21/CSCI-UA.0480-034/_site/syllabus.html

We would get:

http://localhost/xy8zcd

Work in a similar way with the following URL Shortener websites bitly or tinyurl .
